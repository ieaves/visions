class model_relation:
    """Relationship encoder between implementations of :class:`tenzing.core.models.tenzing_model`

    Defines a one to one relationship between two tenzing_model implementations,
    A and B, with respect to an underlying data series. In order to define a relationship we need
    two methods:

        - **is_relationship**, determines whether a series of type B can be alternatively represented as type A.
        - **transform**, provides a mechanism to convert the series from B -> A.

    For example, the series `pd.Series([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])` is encoded as a sequence of
    floats but in reality they are all integers.

    Examples:
        >>> from tenzing.core.model.types import tenzing_integer, tenzing_float
        >>> x = pd.Series([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
        >>> relation = model_relation(tenzing_integer, tenzing_float)
        >>> relation.is_relation(x)
        True

        >>> relation.transform(x)
        pd.Series([1, 2, 3])
